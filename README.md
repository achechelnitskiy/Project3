Frogger Game

The goal of the game is to have a player move accross the field and reach the water without colliding with the bugs.  Player can be moved using up, down, left and right arrows on the keyboard.  In the case collision takes place, the player is moved into the orignal position.  In the case the water is reached, the player has won, and is moved back to the starting point for another round of fun.
